I recently completed a one-month cybersecurity internship with Prodigy Infotech, from 15th January to 14th February. During this time, I got hands-on experience with network security, ethical hacking, encryption, and vulnerability assessment and lots of cool stuff. The internship was fully online, which made it super flexible and allowed me to work through tasks at my own pace while still learning a lot. It was a great experience that gave me a deeper understanding of how to protect digital systems and also I had the opportunity to delve into various aspects of Software Security & Authentication,Computer Networking,Image Processing & Data Security, , System Monitoring & Automation and all. i hope many such exciting challenges come find me.
